# Weather Data Analysis Project with Chat System

## Project Overview

This project combines a weather data analysis and visualization tool with an interactive chat system that leverages a weather API. Users can query weather information through the chat interface, and the system fetches real-time data from the API. The project also provides detailed visualizations of weather trends based on the retrieved data.

Key features include:
- Interactive chat system to request weather information
- Integration with a weather API for real-time data retrieval
- Data cleaning, processing, and analysis of weather data
- Visualizations to display weather patterns such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation trends

This project demonstrates how to build a user-friendly interface combined with powerful data analysis and visualization tools.
