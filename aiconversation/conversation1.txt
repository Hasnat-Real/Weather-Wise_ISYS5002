get_weather Function Explanation
This is a robust Python function that fetches weather data from the wttr.in API with comprehensive error handling and validation.
Function Signature
python
def get_weather(location: str, timeout: int = 10) -> Optional[Dict]:
Parameters:
location: The location to get weather for (required string)
timeout: How long to wait for the API response in seconds (optional, defaults to 10)
Returns: Either a dictionary with weather data or None if something goes wrong
What the API Returns
When successful, the function returns a dictionary containing:
current_condition: Current weather (temperature, humidity, wind, etc.)
weather: Multi-day forecast data
nearest_area: Information about the location found
request: Details about what was requested

Defensive Programming: The function assumes things can go wrong and handles each case gracefully rather than crashing your program.
Clear Feedback: Instead of silent failures, it prints helpful error messages so you know what went wrong.
Flexible Input: Accepts many location formats (city names, coordinates, airport codes) making it versatile.
Production Ready: Includes all the error handling and validation you'd need in a real application, not just a quick script.
The function follows the principle of "fail gracefully" - if anything goes wrong, it returns None and explains the problem, but doesn't crash your entire program.
