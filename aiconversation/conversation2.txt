🤖 AI Response (partial)
I can see you're trying to set up a Python environment with some packages and configuration for an AI chat service. However, there are a few things to clarify:
The commands you've shown (!pip install and the Python code) are meant to be run in a Python environment like Jupyter notebooks or Google Colab, not in this chat interface.
I don't have access to install packages or run pip commands directly.
I can't provide working URLs for external chat services, as I don't have access to verify what's available at specific endpoints.
If you're looking to:
Set up a local Python environment: You'd run these commands in your terminal or notebook
Get help with the code: I can explain what each part does or help troubleshoot

I'll help you modify the code to actually get responses from the AI service. Let me update the script to include proper API calls:

The error shows that the requests module isn't being imported properly. Let me fix this by adding the missing import at the top of the script:
